# Rocket Ship ðŸš€

# Requirements

- Stop the Class rocket from taking off
- Stop the Functional rocket from taking off
- We can only render one of the Class rocket or Functional rocket at a time, but we should be able to swap either component and your solution should still work.

# Think about

- How can we prevent components from re-rendering
