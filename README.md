# react-coding-challenges

A series of React coding challenges for benchmarking new recruits

## How do I submit my solutions?

1. [Duplicate this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository). **Please make your repo private so that others cannot view it, and hence, your solutions**.
2. For each coding challenge in this repo (e.g. _rocket-ship_), create a separate branch for your solution. So, one of your branches might be named **rocket-ship-solution**

- Please note that some of these challenges can have multiple solutions. If you would like to submit more than one solution, simply create another branch (e.g. **rocket-ship-solution-1** and **rocket-ship-solution-2**). Multiple solutions are _optional_.

3. When you're satisfied with your solutions, invite me [bobmccracken](https://github.com/bobmccracken) as a collaborator on your fork. See [inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

## Challenges

### [Rocket Ship](https://github.com/IncentivioInc/react-coding-challenges/tree/main/rocket-ship)

_Unecessary re-renders, fine grained control_

### [Rerenders](https://github.com/IncentivioInc/react-coding-challenges/tree/main/rerenders)

_Unnecessary re-renders_

If you're familiar with the react concepts in play here, this may only take you 5 minutes. If not, you will probably be hitting the react docs + google.

### [Incentivio](https://github.com/IncentivioInc/react-coding-challenges/tree/main/incentivio)

_Redux, Hooks_

Fix the spelling of "incentivio".
