# Incentivio

- Redux
- Hooks

In this exercise you will retrieve some data from a mock api and use it to update a component that should display the string "incentivio".

As you familiarize yourself with the code, you may think "this is stupid" and "why would you do this?" and you wouldn't be entirely wrong. Bear in mind this is just an exercise and we acknowledge it's kind of dumb.

## Getting Started

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Requirements

- Fix the spelling of "incentivio"
- Don't render the correct spelling until all api calls have completed
- Don't change any code in the _do-not-change_ directory
- Don't change any code that has comments specifically prohibiting it

## Hints

- <Incentivio /> uses redux state to construct the string "incentivio". Initially the redux state is incorrect
- The fakeApi has the correct state
- Optimizing renders is _not_ a requirement
- If you did some of the other challenges, you may be thinking this one is also about preventing unnecessary re-renders. That is not the case.
